# University-Directory

This program simulates a directory for a university. It allows the user to enter various information about students or employees that is stored in an object array. The object array can be searched to find a specific person. You may also choose to create a report on a new file when you are finished.

This project was created as a multi-part assingment during my Object Oriented Programming class at The University of Central Florida.
